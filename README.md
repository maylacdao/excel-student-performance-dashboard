![alt text](images/studentperformancedash.png)

Dataset: [Student Performance Data](data/Dataset_Student_Performance.csv)

## Objectives

To create a dashboard that summarizes the analysis of student performance during a previous test.

Questions to be answered:

1. Number/Percentage of students who passed/failed
2. Overall average scores across subjects being tested for
3. Compare student performance vs gender/parental level of education/lunch/test preparation
4. Summary statistics

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

**Step 1 - Convert dataset format from CSV to XLSX**

The original dataset is saved in XLSX format, to (1) preserve the integrity of the raw data and (2) ensure that all changes will be saved.

**Step 2 - Clean data**

Format header row to make it distinguishable from the rest of the data (suggest making the font bold and adding a cell fill). You can also freeze the header row to keep it visible while you scroll down the file. Add filters to the data (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L) to see the unique values in each column. Check for null values.

Make adjustments to make the data easier to view (i.e. center-aligning, adjusting column widths, etc.)

**Step 3 - Analyze Data to Answer the Questions**
